Pyry: why can't we just hunt for some rabbits this time? all we do is try to kill wolves all day, lucky we are still alive.

Fren: stop whining, I won't settle for anything less than a wolf, rabbits are too easy.

Fren: and think about it, if there are less wolves, there will be more rabbits for you to hunt later without me.

Pyry: why do you even need me then? just hunt them on your own...

Fren: to help carry the meat ofc, now be quiet.
