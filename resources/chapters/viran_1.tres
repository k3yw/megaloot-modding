She's regenerating...

Look at yourself Viran, your wounds are closing.
Now  I must know how far I can push the damages to the body...

But dad... I feel sick... said Viran

Gogen casted a spell to analyze her body, that's strange, she should not feel any pain...
Not after that amount pain killers

But after noticing the flaw of his experiment
Dreadfully he said, it not perfect... not yet


The body produces poison as a byproduct of regeneration and since the poison is technically a part of the body, it ignores it...
She's still not immortal like me..
