text = "When Pyry was young his voice was stolen by a vampire, turning him into an altermage in the process.

Altermages are different from normal mages, they cannot handle their magic and die shortly after becoming one.

Pyry was lucky and a mark was placed on him by another mage to remove the excess magic from his body, thus keeping him alive.
